# income-tax-pensions
This is where we make API calls from users viewing and making changes to the Pensions section of their income tax return.

## Running the service locally

You will need to have the following:
- Installed/configured [service manager](https://github.com/hmrc/service-manager).

The service manager profile for this service is:

    sm --start INCOME_TAX_PENSIONS
Run the following command to start the remaining services locally:

    sudo mongod (If not already running)
    sm --start INCOME_TAX_SUBMISSION_ALL -r

This service runs on port: `localhost:9322`
